# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-to-create-new-Football-Metrics
This project applies PCA and K-Means clustering to uncover hidden patterns in football data. It reduces dimensionality, can groups teams by playstyle, and helps create new performance metrics. Features include optimal cluster selection, variance analysis, and visualizations.
